Please read the [[Using TinyTDS]] page which covers all the details for all platforms.

Headings that have a __*tested*__ after it have been confirmed to pass all the adapters test suite. If you have found that a method that is marked as __*untested*__ does pass all the tests, please let us know and/or update the wiki.
